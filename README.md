# Dotfiles

# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are configuration files that are used to customize your system.

## Installation

To install these dotfiles, you can run the installation script `links.sh`. This script creates hard links to the `.dotfiles` of this directory. If the file already exists, it prompts the user if they want to replace it.
